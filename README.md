To stalk and send the stalk to slack

Use this app to create geofences, and whenever you enter or exit a geofence, a slack message is sent.
I used this when I worked at multiple offices to let my coworkers know where I was each day.
You need google map API credentials and slack credentials; see config.h for details.

This is only meant to be ran in dev mode on your device; it is not made to be distributed through the app store.
